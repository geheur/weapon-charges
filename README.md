Interested in collecting chat messages/dialogs to improve this plugin's charge tracking, or reporting actions that change charges but aren't tracked? DM me on discord: geheur#4508.

# Weapon charges
Estimates how many charges your weapons have left.

Currently Tracked are:
 - Toxic Blowpipe
 - Iban's Staff
 - Tridents
 - Crystal Halberd
 - Crystal Bow
 - Tome of Fire / Water
 - Arclight
 - Craws Bow
 - Viggora's Chainmace
 - Thammaron's Sceptre
 - Tentacle Whip
 - Scythe of Vitur
 - Sanguinesti Staff
 - Serpentine Helm (and Tanzanite / Magma Variants)
 - Crystal Armor
 - Bow of Faerdhinen

Some are better tracked than others, and many are untested because I don't have these weapons.

Thanks to [Blackberry0Pie](https://github.com/Blackberry0Pie) for adding tome of water and craws/viggoras/thammarons, as well as fixing sang staff.
